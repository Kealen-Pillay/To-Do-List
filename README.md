# TaskIt
TaskIt is a simple to do list application created using the MERN technology stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, Nodejs) in conjunction with Typescript. This application allows users to register to create an account or log in to the application with an exiting account. Once logged in, the user is greeted with their task board containing all outstanding tasks. New tasks can be created and assigned a unique color tag to categorise their tasks. Tasks can be completed or deleted.
